# TalentSync â€“ Email + CRM

To enable real email sending and tracking:

- Create a Resend account and get an API key.
- Set environment variables in a `.env.local` at project root:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
FROM_EMAIL=you@yourdomain.com
```

- Start the app and create a campaign. Use "Send now" to deliver.

Notes:
- Open/click tracking endpoints are provided. Clicks redirect via `/api/track/click` and opens load a tracking pixel. For production-grade tracking with authenticated webhooks and server DB storage, wire these endpoints to a real database.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
